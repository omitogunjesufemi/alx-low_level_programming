# 0x06. C-More pointers, arrays and strings

> This project helped to understand pointers, arrays, strings, how to use them, with the manipulation of strings and the memory layout of a computer process.

*This project contains the following tasks:*

TASK | DESCRIPTION
--- | ---
`0-strcat.c` | A function that concatenates two strings.
`1-strncat.c` | A function that concatenate two strings. The `_strncat` function is similar to the _strcat function, except that it will use at most `n` bytes from `src`; and `src` does not need to be null-terminated if it contains `n` or more bytes.
`2-strncpyc` | A function that copies a string.
`3-strcmp.c` | A function that compares two strings.
`4-rev_array.c` | A function that reverse the content of an array of integers.
`5-string_toupper.c` | A function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
`6-cap_string.c` | A function that capitalise all words of a string.
`7-leet.c` | A function that encodes a string into [1337](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/9v9KfpvWnL0GoMu5mozbug).
`100-rot13.c` | A function that encodes a string using [rot13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13).
`101-print_number.c` | A function that prints an integer.
`102-magic.c` | Create magic by adding one line to this [code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/make_magic_happen/blob/master/magic.c), so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line.
`103-infinite_add.c` | A function that adds two numbers.
`104-print_buffer.c` | A function that prints a buffer.
