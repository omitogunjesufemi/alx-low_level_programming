# 0x0A. C - argc, argv

> This project helped explain the arguments to main, what argc and argv meant, how to use arguments passed to a program, the two prototypes of main and which case senearios to use them, and how to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters.

## Tasks and Description
*This project contains the following tasks:*
TASK | DESCRIPTION
--- | ---
`0-whatsmyname.c` | A program that prints its name, followed by a new line. If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again. You should not remove the path before the name of the program.
`1-args.c` | A program that prints the number of arguments passed into it. Your program should print a number, followed by a new line.
`2-args.c` | A program that prints all arguments it receives. All arguments should be printed, including the first one. Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line.
`3-mul.c` | A program that multiplies two numbers. Your program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line. You can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer. If the program does not receive two arguments, your program should print `Error`, followed by a new line, and return `1`.
