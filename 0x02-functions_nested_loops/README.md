# 0x02. C-Functions, nested loops
> This project explains nested loops and ow to use them, what functions are and how to use them, the difference between a declaration and definition of a function. What a prototype is, scope of variables, header files and how to use them.

*The project contains the following tasks:*

TASK | DESCRIPTION
--- | ---
`0-putchar.c` | This prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line.
`1-alphabet.c` | A function that prints the alphabet in lowercase
`2-print_alphabet_x10.c` | A function that  prints 10 times the alphabet in lowercase
`3-islower.c` | A function that checks for lowercase character.
`4-isalpha.c` | A function that checks for alphabetic character.
`5-sign.c` | A function that prints the sign of a number.
`6-abs.c` | A function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
`7-print_last_digit.c` | A function that prints the last digit of a number.
`8-24_hours.c` | A function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
`9-times_table.c` | A function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
`10-add.c` | A function that adds two integers and returns the result.
`11-print_to_98.c` | A function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
`100-times_table.c` | A function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.
`101-natural.c` | This is a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of `3` or `5` below `1024` (excluded), followed by a new line.
`102-fibonacci` | This is a program that prints the first `50` Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`, followed by a new line.
`103-fibonacci` | This is a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, followed by a new line.
`104-fibonacci` | This is a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
