# 0x0b. C - malloc, free

> This project has helped explain the concept of automatic allocation of memory done by the system itself, and also dynamic allocation using `malloc()` and `free()`. It showed the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation, what `malloc` and `free` are and how to use them, why `malloc` should be used and also how to use `valgrind to check for memory leak.`

## Tasks and Description
*The project contains the following task:*

TASK | DESCRIPTION
--- | ---
`0-create_array.c` | A function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
`1-strdup.c` | A function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
`2-str_concat` | A function that concatenates two strings.
`3-alloc_grid.c` | A function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
`4-free_grid.c` | A function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.
`100-argstostr` | A function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.
`101-strtow.c` | A function that splits a string into words.
