# 0x04. C-More functions, more nested loops

> This project is an extension of the 0x02. C-Functions, nested loops project. This is to solidify my understanding on the use of nested loops, functions, function prototype, scope variables and header files.

*The project contains the following task:*

TASK | DESCRIPTION
--- | ---
`0-isupper.c` | This is a function that checks for uppercase characters.
`1-isdigit.c` | This is a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
`2-mul.c` | This is a function that multiplies two integers.
`3-print_numbers.c` | This is a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line.
`4-print_most_numbers.c` | This is a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line. It does not print `2` and `4`.
`5-more_numbers.c` | This is a function that prints 10 times the numbers from `0` to `14`, followed by a new line.
`6-print_line.c` | This is a function that draws a straight line in the terminal, where `n` determines the length of the line.
`7-print_diagonal.c` | This is a function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal, where `n` is the determinant for the length of the line.
`8-print_square.c` | This is a function that prints a square, followed by a new line, where `size` is the size of the square.
`9-fizz_buzz` | This is a program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line, but for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five prints `Buzz`. For numbers that are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.
`10-print_triangle.c` | This is a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line, where `size` is the size of the triangle.
