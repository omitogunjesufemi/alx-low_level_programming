# 0x0C. C - More malloc, free

> This project has helped explain the concept of automatic allocation of memory done by the system itself, and also dynamic allocation using malloc() and free(). It showed the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation, what malloc and free are and how to use them, why malloc should be used and also how to use valgrind to check for memory leak.
